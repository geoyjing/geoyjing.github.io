  <p><strong>📢 Current Opening</strong> </p>
 <p>
    I am seeking a self-motivated Master’s student to join my research group as a Graduate Research Assistant.
   The group's research focuses on GIScience, transportation geography, and spatial networks, with particular interest
    in applying GIS and network science methods to study transportation systems and human mobility. We study how people move and interact within cities, how these patterns are shaped by spatial
    structure and the built environment, and how they relate to socioeconomic outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The selected student will have opportunities to contribute to ongoing projects and to develop independent
    research aligned with these themes. This is a fully funded, two-year position that includes a full tuition
    waiver, a stipend, and health benefits.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Minimum Qualifications</strong> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bachelor’s degree in Geography, Geographic Information Systems, Urban Planning, or a related field</li>
    <li>Strong academic background and motivation for independent research</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Preferred Qualifications</strong> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Strong analytical and quantitative skills</li>
    <li>Experience with programming (e.g., Python, R, Julia)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The priority deadline for funding consideration is earlier than the official program deadline. Although the
    formal application deadline for the M.S. program is May 1, 2026, funding decisions will be made on a rolling
    basis before that date. Interested students are strongly encouraged to reach out as early as possible.
  </p>
