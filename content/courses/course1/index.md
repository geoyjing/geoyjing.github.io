## Introduction

The course covers topics including data measurement, descriptive statistics, probability distributions, samples and populations, sampling, hypothesis testing, and inference. It is designed to ensure students gain a fundamental understanding of basic statistical procedures and scientific methods. It lays the foundations for intermediate and advanced topics such as multivariate methods, spatial statistics, and econometrics. Students will learn how to apply statistical concepts and techniques, use analytical software (JMP Pro and GeoDa) as well as gain a critical perspective on the data used in statistical analyses. 

Upon the completion of the course, learners will be able to:
> 
+ Identify and classify different types of data and apply appropriate statistical tests accordingly.
+ Evaluate the quality of data used in statistical analyses, recognizing the impact of input quality on output accuracy.
+ Explain the core principles underlying different types of statistical analyses.
+ Utilize statistical software to implement and execute statistical concepts and methods covered in the course.
